My first repository. I am NOT a programmer by any means, these are mere scripts to help me automate some of my work. I would love to be one in he near future, and I figure this is great practice. Please go easy on this lowly squire.

ComparisonStrings.py - Compares string values, very basic -  I use this to put inventory back in their shelve locations. By scanning the SKU location, and the SKU from the product it compares and show a message. Depending if the string values match or not.

refturnsForm.py - Takes user input  that is related to receiving, such as Cust name, E-mail, Order, SKU names and qty etc.. and writes into a CSV file.
