# CompareStrings
My first repository, please go easy on me. Compares string values, very basic - been learning python and programming in general for a a few months now. I work in a warehouse, and use this to put inventory back in their shelve locations. By scanning the SKU location, and the SKU itself it will compare and show a message.

#2 refturnsForm.py - Takes user input  that is related to receiving, such as Cust name, E-mail, Order, SKU names and qty etc.. and writes into a CSV file.
